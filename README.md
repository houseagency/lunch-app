# lunch-spinner-app

Description:
The problem our 'client' often do not know where to go for lunch. We need help to decide.
In version 1.0, we think of a web app that works as well on desktop as in the mobile phone. 

The client wanted something visual where you randomize the day's lunch restaurant.
It should be fast and built in javascript in any modern framework.

Clients Requirements:
- JS framework (e.g React)
- Please use any "build chain" like NWB (https://github.com/insin/nwb), Webpack, Gulp or Grunt.

Some brief ideas about what later versions may contain:
- Backend to manage the restaurants
- Integrate external APIs, such as maps, weather, restaurant hooks
- Login to the app
- Voting.
